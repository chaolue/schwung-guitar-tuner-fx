"""Every help.json line must fit the 128px screen.

A help line is drawn at x=4 and never wrapped: past x=127 it is silently cut,
with nothing logged. Measured with the device font's glyph widths
(tests/font_widths.json, taken from Schwung's font table). A character with no
glyph is drawn as a gap, so it fails too.

The viewer reads the top-level `children` and nothing else -- a help.json
written as `sections` (as the tool's was) is silently never shown.
